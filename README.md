### ðŸ–¼ UI/UX Design and Inspiration

The map based search and interaction design in CropCurious was heavily inspired by the exceptional user experience of the AllTrails app. I admire AllTrails' seamless integration of map navigation, smooth transitions, and intuitive search interactions â€” and aimed to replicate that level of polish where possible.

From gesture driven bottom sheets to dynamic map overlays, this project is a personal attempt to bring AllTrails-like design quality into an agricultural field scouting context.
